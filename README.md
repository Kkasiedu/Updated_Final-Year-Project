# NDVI Imaging Application for Precision Agriculture

This is a final year project developed by a Computer Engineering student to simplify access to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) technology for small and medium-scale farmers in Ghana.

## 📌 Project Description

The application is designed as a desktop-based NDVI analysis tool, built using **C++**, **OpenCV**, and **wxWidgets**. It enables users to load and process infrared (NIR) and visible light (RGB) images to generate NDVI maps, providing insights into plant health and aiding better agricultural decisions.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 📂 File Explorer for loading folders of images
- 🖼️ NDVI calculation from NIR and RGB images
- 🗺️ Visualization of NDVI maps
- 💬 Output panel for logs and analysis results
- 🖥️ User-friendly GUI built with wxWidgets

## ⚠️ Work in Progress

The application is still under active development. While the NDVI image analysis is functional, the **video and image streaming features are not yet fully implemented**. Currently, the following limitations exist:

- 📹 Live video feed from the infrared camera is not stable or fully integrated
- 📸 Real-time capture and display of images is incomplete
- 🧪 Further testing is required for performance and device compatibility

These features will be completed in future iterations of the application.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **OpenCV**
- **wxWidgets**
- **NDVI Calculation Algorithms**

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and build using your preferred C++ IDE (Visual Studio or Code::Blocks recommended). Ensure OpenCV,wxWidgets and boost  are installed and properly linked.
